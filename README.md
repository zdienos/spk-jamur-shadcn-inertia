## CI/CD Guide

This project includes automated CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions. The workflows are located in the `.github/workflows/` directory and provide continuous integration and deployment capabilities.

### Available Workflows

#### 1. Tests Workflow (`test.yml`)

Automatically runs on every push to the `main` branch and performs:

- **PHP Setup:** Uses PHP 8.2 with required extensions
- **Environment Setup:** Copies `.env.example` to `.env` and generates application key
- **Dependencies:** Installs Composer dependencies
- **Frontend Build:** Installs Node.js dependencies and builds production assets
- **Database Setup:** Creates SQLite database for testing
- **Test Execution:** Runs PHPUnit/Pest tests (unit and feature tests)

#### 2. Deploy Workflow (`deploy.yml`)

Automatically deploys to production server on successful pushes to `main` branch:

- **Code Deployment:** Uses rsync to sync code to production server
- **Frontend Build:** Builds production assets before deployment
- **Dependencies:** Installs/updates Composer dependencies via Docker
- **Database Migration:** Runs Laravel migrations
- **Cache Management:** Clears and optimizes application cache
- **Docker Integration:** Restarts Docker containers for updated services

### Required Secrets

For the deployment workflow to work, configure these GitHub repository secrets:

- `PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key for server access
- `SSH_HOST` - Production server hostname/IP
- `SSH_USER` - SSH username for server access
- `WORK_DIR` - Application directory path on server
- `DOCKER_DIR` - Docker compose directory path on server

### Local Development Workflow

1. **Before Committing:**

   ```bash
   # Run tests locally
   php artisan test

   # Build frontend assets
   pnpm run build

   # Check code formatting
   pnpm run lint
   ```

2. **Push to Main:**
   - Tests workflow runs automatically
   - If tests pass and on `main` branch, deployment begins
   - Monitor workflow progress in GitHub Actions tab

### Workflow Customization

To modify the CI/CD behavior:

- **Test Configuration:** Edit `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- **Deployment Steps:** Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Add Quality Checks:** Consider adding code style checks, static analysis, or security scans

## Roadmap

Here are some of the planned features for future updates:

- **User Permissions & Roles:** Manage user roles and permissions with a flexible and intuitive system.

- **Profile Manager:** Allow users to update their profiles, including personal information and security settings.

- **Post & Page Manager:** Create and manage dynamic posts and pages with a rich text editor.

- **Theme & Plugin Manager:** Easily install and manage themes and plugins to extend functionality.

- **File & Media Manager:** A powerful file and media manager for handling uploads and organizing assets.
